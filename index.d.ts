	By default, in a TTY context the promise resolves with an empty string. This avoids hanging CLIs that only want piped input and lets them fall back to other input methods. An empty string means no input was read. To read from a TTY, set `allowTTY: true` and explicitly close `stdin` (Ctrl+D on Unix, Ctrl+Z on Windows).

	```
	// example.ts
	import getStdin from 'get-stdin';

	console.log(await getStdin());
	//=> 'unicorns'
	```

	Run the script with piped input:
	```
	$ echo unicorns | npx ts-node example.ts
	unicorns
	```

	Or run interactively by allowing TTY input and type input, then press Ctrl+D (Unix) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to signal end of input:

	```
	// example.ts
	import getStdin from 'get-stdin';

	console.log(await getStdin({allowTTY: true}));
	//=> 'unicorns'
	```
